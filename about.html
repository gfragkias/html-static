					<h3>As you have already seen my name is George Fragkias.<br> I was born in Athens, grown in Amaliada and now I am an undergraduate student in the University of Thessaly at the Electrical Engineering Department in Volos, Greece and I am close to the end of my student days.<br> Studying a field such as Computer Science, which is particularly fascinating because of its wide variety of applications, is also quite demanding since everything is advancing rapidly.In order to keep up with the new technologies and expand my knowledge, I sometimes try to take on online courses and take part in group projects.<br></h3>
